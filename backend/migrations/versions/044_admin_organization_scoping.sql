-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 044: Add organization_id to admins for scanner authorization
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Adds organization_id (nullable) to the admins table to enable
-- org-scoped scanner access control.
--
-- Organization scoping rules:
--   organization_id IS NULL  → Super-admin: can scan tickets for any organization
--   organization_id = <id>   → Restricted to that organization only
--
-- The scan middleware validates that the authenticated admin's organization_id
-- matches the ticket's organization, unless the admin is a super-admin (NULL).
